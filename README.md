# Fff1 Stopwatch

This project was born out of sheer boredom.

In the training of the Freindorf 1 competition group, times of our runs are always taken and written down. This Angular application therefore includes a stopwatch with a lap function.

For runs in the Silver category, the positions will be allocated randomly. For this purpose, the application contains a randomizer of these existing positions.

In order to be able to keep an eye on success, all times are stored in Firebase. These can be called up and viewed in the diary-section.
